## Family

This project exists in an impossibly complex web of
trans and queer textile projects that extends both
backwards and sideways through time.

We also find siblingship with other projects outside
of the textile world.

Below are short, living lists of some of these
projects. Theyâ€™re quite incomplete. Please contact
[{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you have other
projects that feel like they belong here.
