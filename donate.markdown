## Donation Information

This project not only makes quilts for trans people but does so by hiring 8 trans artists to collaborate on each quilt. We work with trans interviewers, audio editors, artists in multiple mediums and finally textile designers and quilters to make each quilt. We also have a team of trans and queer community advisors who are helping envision the project on a broad scale. That is to say, these quilts cost money, and if you’re someone with access to that resource, we’d love if you’d consider sharing some!

80% of the total project budget is going directly to trans artists with the remaining portion allocated for materials

Amounts:

* giving $1,500 (or some multiple of that) would sponsor a full quilt
* donating $150 would sponsor one artist’s contribution to a quilt

This project is 501c3 fiscally sponsored by Kala Institute which allows us to receive gifts that are tax deductible for you. It also means we can accept money from corporate matches, family foundations, certain grants etc. If you work at a job with corporate match benefits, please reach out! And thank you to Kala for that support.

If you donate through Kala, 10% of your donation will be taken away for administrative fees. If you’re able to donate directly through check or venmo, we will get 100% of the funds. Please message [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you’d like to support but need to do so through some other channel.
