<h2>Artist Roster</h2>

<p>
  On this page youâ€™ll find a roster of trans artists who are willing to share their work for <a href="{{ "/process" | relative_url }}">phase two</a> of the quilt design. Quilt recipients can choose artists from their life or from this list to contribute to the quilt. These commissions come with a small honorarium.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a trans artist and interested in being part of this list, please message <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> to say hello.
