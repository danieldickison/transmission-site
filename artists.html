<h2>Artist Roster</h2>

<p>
On this page you’ll find a roster of trans artists that
are down to share their work for <a href="{{ "/process" | relative_url }}">phase 2</a>. In the
event a quilt recipient does not have three trans
artists from their life they’d like to select,
someone(s) from this page will sub in to help out.
</p>
<p>
If you are a trans artist and interested in being part
of this list, please message
[{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with your name,
medium(s) and a bit about you. These commissions
come with a small honorarium.
</p>
