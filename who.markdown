## Artist Roster {#artist-roster}

On this page you’ll find a roster of trans artists that
are down to share their work for phase 2. In the
event a quilt recipient does not have three trans
artists from their life they’d like to select,
someone(s) from this page will sub in to help out.

If you are a trans artist and interested in being part
of this list, please message
[transmissionsquilts@gmail.com](mailto:transmissionsquilts@gmail.com) with your name,
medium(s) and a bit about you. These commissions
come with a small honorarium.

### Cam McCuskey

### Ro Oppenheimer

### Kerbi Urbanowski (?)
