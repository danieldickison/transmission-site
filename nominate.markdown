## Nominate

Please follow [this link](https://forms.gle/uJphyD7UyYo8KG6X9) to nominate someone to receive a quilt.

This project hopes to make 20 quilts that represent a variety of trans experiences. As such, we are particularly interested in the experience of trans people of color living rurally. We also want to make quilts intergenerationally, so think both olders and youngers! There are so many other flavors that could be mentioned here and we welcome them all.
