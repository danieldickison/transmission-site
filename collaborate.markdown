## Collaborate

Thank you for viewing our Textile Talk! Here are some resources for you to learn more, get involved and support our work.

As a reminder, we are fundraising to make 5 more quilts. Each quilt costs $2000 to pay up to 10 trans artists working across textiles, words, sound and photography. We would be so grateful if you have the means to contribute financially - some people like to fully sponsor a quilt, others opt for co-sponsorhip, and others support by "sponsoring an artist" for $200. Smaller numbers are perfect too, as in, any amount helps!!! Whatever is possible for you, we are grateful for the chance to keep making this work in a way that supports our community. It is rare for quilters to be paid meaningfully for our work. It is especially rare for trans/queer artists to be given the chance to do so. Remember, 91% of all money we raise goes directly to trans artists.

Some people prefer to make a tax-deductible donation to Kala Art Institute, our fiscal sponsor. Please message the project email directly to make this happen! Please note: this one loses 10% in admin fees but is a great option if you are making a larger gift or if you are making a donation through a corporate matching program or DAF, etc.


And an invitation:
This project has become itself due to the random reachings out
of people who are excited to collaborate. Contact
[{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you’d like to be involved in
any way.
