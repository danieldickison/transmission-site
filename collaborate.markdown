## Collaborate

We are currently closed for nominations as we have already
selected the next 18 quilt recipients.

This project has become itself due to the random reachings out
of people who are excited to collaborate. Contact
[transmissionsquilts@gmail.com](mailto:transmissionsquilts@gmail.com) if youâ€™d like to be involved in
any way.

Please especially contact us if:

- you are a trans textile artist/quilter located in the Bay Area
- you are a trans woodworker or photographer in the Bay Area
- you are Bay Area venue who might want to exhibit these objects
- you are a possible funder (individual or organizational) who
would like to support this project and get trans artists paid
