## Collaborate

Thank you for viewing our Textile Talk! Here are some resources for you to learn more, get involved and support our work.

As a reminder, we are fundraising to make more quilts, which each cost $2000 to pay up to 10 trans artists working across textiles, words, sound and photography. If you would like to sponsor a quilt or support at a lower tier, we are so grateful for the chance to keep making this work in a way that supports our community of artists.
