## Process

Each piece begins when someone is [nominated]({{ "/nominate" | relative_url }}) to receive a quilt.

Once selected, the quilt recipient follows the three phase
process outlined below. The phases step through ever widening
concentric circles of community. They span from 1:1 to small
group to a final larger gathering.

May these quilts remind us of the webs
that hold us all together.

### Phase 1

The quilt recipient chooses a dear friend to interview them.

/>

The interview is audio recorded and edited down.

### Phase 2

The quilt recipient chooses three trans artists working in any medium.

These artists each make a piece that is inspired by the audio recordings.

### Phase 3

The quilter uses the three pieces of art to design a quilt.
When the quilt is ready, we throw a community quilting bee to
put in the final stitches.

/>

The quilt recipient then ends up with a quilt, audio files and
pieces of art made in phase two.

Further down the line, we will explore how to exhibit these pieces
collectively.

along the way to accommodate our younger siblings.</em>
