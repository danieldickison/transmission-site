## The Process

Each piece begins when someone is nominated to receive a quilt.

Once selected, the quilt recipient follows the three phase process*
outlined below. The phases step through concentric circles of
community, spanning from 1:1 to small group to larger community.
May they serve as a reminder of the webs that hold all of us
together.

### Phase 1

The quilt recipient gets to choose a dear friend to interview
them. The interview is audio recorded and edited down by an audio
editor.

### Phase 2

The quilt recipient chooses three trans artists working in
any medium. These artists each make a piece that is inspired by the
audio files.

### Phase 3

The quilter uses the three pieces of art to design a quilt top.
When the quilt top is ready, we throw a community quilting bee to
put in the finishing stitches.

The quilt recipient then ends up with a quilt, the audio files and the
pieces of art made in phase 2.

Further down the line, we will explore how to exhibit these pieces
collectively.

<em>\* This process works with both adults and teens and modifies slightly
along the way to accommodate our younger siblings.</em>
