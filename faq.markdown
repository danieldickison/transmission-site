## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why quilts and audio?

Quilts and audio both answer the question “what will last?” This question
has always been relevant and yet feels particularly present these days.

What will last? The physical, the durable, the object from my grandma. If
the future has people, may those people stay warm.

What will last? The ambient, the fleeting, the short-wave audio file saved
on this cassette. If the future has music, may we contribute to its
soundscape.

### What is a quilting bee?

A quilting bee is a traditional gathering space where often women and
gender-exploded people could gather and make work together. They
share stitches but perhaps more importantly they share food, gossip and
the commitment to keeping each other safe. They are the places where
people who are not given places make themselves a place.
How is this a textile project when many of the collaborating artists are
working in other mediums?

I make quilts because they can hold anything. This project is a celebration
and a test of that. Let’s see how jazz music, tattoos and a ceramic mug can
smash together to make a quilt.

### Does my friend deserve a quilt?

### How many years do I have to be quilting to be able to get involved in this project?
