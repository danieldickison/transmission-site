The Transmissions Quilt Project started with the simple impulse to make affirming gift objects for trans friends and lovers. It is now blossoming with the hopes of sharing these objects with broader community.

This new chapter is just a more elaborate version of the original project. The impulses are the same: welcome trans people to themselves shower them with gifts and offer the reminder that the web of life holds them fiercely.

## History {#history}

<div class="col-left" markdown="1">

### Chapter 1

This project came to me three years ago when a lover shared the blanket they had been given to celebrate their birth. With their dead name emblazoned across one corner in purple, they shared the grief
that came with relating to an object that didn’t feel like it was actually made for them.

This spurred me to make them a quilt (my first quilt!) in the hopes of welcoming them into their current self.

From there, I went on to make a series of these quilts for trans friends.
Not baby blankets, per se, but arrival objects. The piece that sees and
welcomes them. I made six more.

### Chapter 2

I now find myself beginning the next iteration of this project. After
getting the feedback that this project has legs and should be shared
with broader community, I’ve developed a process that makes these
available to people I don’t yet know.

People are nominated to receive a quilt and then go through a three
phase process. Along the way, they get to choose trans and queer
loved ones who are commissioned to help make the quilt. They also
are encouraged to invite broader community together to a
culminating quilting bee, where we all gather to put finishing stitches
into the quilt in an evening of food and gossip.

Further down the line, these quilts and the various elements that
went into making them will be exhibited in some way. The steps of this
project are crafted to mirror the variety of ways that trans people
come to know themselves and locate themselves in the broader
social weave. A culminating exhibit is one version of this witnessing.

## Family {#family}

This project exists in an impossibly complex web of
trans and queer textile projects that extends both
backwards and sideways through time.

We also find siblingship with other projects outside
of the textile world.

Below are short, living lists of some of these
projects. They’re quite incomplete. Please contact
[transmissionsquilts@gmail.com](mailto:transmissionsquilts@gmail.com) if you have other
projects that feel like they belong here.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

### Why quilts and audio?

Quilts and audio both answer the question “what will last?” This question
has always been relevant and yet feels particularly present these days.

What will last? The physical, the durable, the object from my grandma. If
the future has people, may those people stay warm.

What will last? The ambient, the fleeting, the short-wave audio file saved
on this cassette. If the future has music, may we contribute to its
soundscape.

### What is a quilting bee?

A quilting bee is a traditional gathering space where often women and
gender-exploded people could gather and make work together. They
share stitches but perhaps more importantly they share food, gossip and
the commitment to keeping each other safe. They are the places where
people who are not given places make themselves a place.
How is this a textile project when many of the collaborating artists are
working in other mediums?

I make quilts because they can hold anything. This project is a celebration
and a test of that. Let’s see how jazz music, tattoos and a ceramic mug can
smash together to make a quilt.

### Does my friend deserve a quilt?

yes :)

### How many years do I have to be quilting to be able to get involved in this project?

absolutely zilch get in here girl.
