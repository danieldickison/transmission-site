## History

The Transmissions Quilt Project started with the simple impulse to make affirming gift objects for trans friends and lovers. It is now blossoming with the hopes of sharing these objects with broader community.

This new chapter is just a more elaborate version of the original project. The impulses are the same: welcome trans people to themselves shower them with gifts and offer the reminder that the web of life holds them fiercely.

### Chapter 1

This project came to me three years ago when a lover shared the blanket they had been given to celebrate their birth. With their dead name emblazoned across one corner in purple, they shared the grief
that came with relating to an object that didn’t feel like it was actually made for them.

This spurred me to make them a quilt (my first quilt!) in the hopes of welcoming them into their current self.

From there, I went on to make a series of these quilts for trans friends.
Not baby blankets, per se, but arrival objects. The piece that sees and
welcomes them. I made six more.

### Chapter 2

I now find myself beginning the next iteration of this project. After
getting the feedback that this project has legs and should be shared
with broader community, I’ve developed a process that makes these
available to people I don’t yet know.

People are nominated to receive a quilt and then go through a three
phase process. Along the way, they get to choose trans and queer
loved ones who are commissioned to help make the quilt. They also
are encouraged to invite broader community together to a
culminating quilting bee, where we all gather to put finishing stitches
into the quilt in an evening of food and gossip.

Further down the line, these quilts and the various elements that
went into making them will be exhibited in some way. The steps of this
project are crafted to mirror the variety of ways that trans people
come to know themselves and locate themselves in the broader
social weave. A culminating exhibit is one version of this witnessing.
