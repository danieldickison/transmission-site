Transmissions is a project
    that makes quilts
     for trans people
</p>

<p id="landing-p2">
Quilts have been given as gifts
    to mark life transition
   across time and cultures.
  They help us see ourselves
    on longer time scales,
      which is something
        that many trans
         people canâ€™t
            access
</p>

<p id="landing-p3">
May these quilts
 keep us living
</p>
